USVN
================

## Introduction
It is a container that provides subversion and USVN with docker.
The files in the container are quarantined from the host side. If you need to save persistent files, use the -v option to mount the host-side directory to:
*/var/lib/svn*

How to use

## Argument

+ `USVN_SUBDIR`:
    Specify a subdirectory of the URL. By default there are no subdirectories.
    The specification should start with / and not end with /, such as `USVN_SUBDIR=/usvn`.
    If you set `USVN_SUBDIR=/usvn`,` http://server IP/usvn/ `will be the current directory.
    Please use it when operating as a subdirectory using a reverse proxy.

### When operating as a subdirectory

This is an example of operating under the following conditions.

+ Server IP 192.168.1.100
+ Operation directory http://192.168.1.100/usvn
+ Persistent directory /var/lib/usvn
```
    docker run -d \
      --name usvn \
      -v /var /lib/usvn:/var/lib/svn:rw \
      -e USVN_SUBDIR=/usvn \
      -p 80:80 \
      $USER/usvn
```
## Limitations
+ Persistent data used once executed cannot be moved to another subdirectory
In the directory to be made persistent, the setting of which subdirectory to operate is described.
Currently, it does not have a conversion function, so it cannot be operated in another subdirectory as it is.
To make it a different subdirectory, you need to change the setting information in the config directory in the persistent directory.

## TODO
+ LDAP connection is not successful, so investigation is required
